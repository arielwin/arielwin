I am currently contracted to the Department of Transportation Federal Highway Adminstration (DOT FHWA) as a GIS QA Specialist, inventorying roads within parks managed by the National Park Service (NPS), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and Fish and Wildlife.
I am currently working to develop skills which will help automate daily tasks and long term projects.
