### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Glad you could join me here on GitHuB!

I am currently enrolled in the Software Engineering Bootcamp with General Assembly! The course is slated to end September 12, 2024.

I am excited to be in this course and for the chance to start creating!

At my last position I was contracted to the Department of Transportation Federal Highway Adminstration (DOT FHWA) as a GIS QA Specialist, inventorying roads within parks managed by the National Park Service (NPS), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and Fish and Wildlife.


In addition to my practical knowledge in GIS, I am a skilled sailor, auto enthusiast and and all around gear-head.
