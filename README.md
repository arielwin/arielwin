### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently contracted to the Department of Transportation Federal Highway Adminstration (DOT FHWA) as a GIS QA Specialist, inventorying roads within parks managed by the National Park Service (NPS), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and Fish and Wildlife.

I am currently working on https://github.com/practical-tutorials/project-based-learning to develop skills which will help automate daily tasks and long term projects. Hopefully by the time you are reading this I have a few more repositories on my profile.

In addition to my practical knowledge in GIS, I am a skilled sailor, auto enthusiast and and all around gear-head.
